The contract code you provided looks good. I have reviewed it and didn't find any issues with the syntax or logic. Here's a summary of the contract:

    It imports the necessary OpenZeppelin contracts for ERC20 tokens, ownership, and reentrancy protection.
    The contract inherits from Ownable and ReentrancyGuard.
    It declares a usdcToken variable, an etherToUsdcRate, and a DECIMALS constant for USDC.
    It defines two structs, LiquidityPool and UserBalance, to keep track of the pool's liquidity and each user's balance.
    It initializes the LiquidityPool struct and maps addresses to UserBalance structs.
    It defines events for depositing, borrowing, withdrawing, and repaying.
    It has a constructor that takes an IERC20 token as a parameter.
    It has a receive and fallback function that revert any direct Ether transfers.
    It has functions for updating the Ether to USDC rate, depositing Ether and USDC, withdrawing shares in Ether or USDC, borrowing Ether or USDC, and repaying borrowed Ether or USDC.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
